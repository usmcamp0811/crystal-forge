## Master Prompt for Crystal Forge-Style Slides

You are creating slides for a presentation about [TOPIC] using Slidev with a custom dark theme inspired by Crystal Forge branding.

VISUAL THEME:

- Dark color scheme: Background #1a1825, text #d8d8ff to #cbb6ff
- Purple/violet accent gradient: #a58cff → #6f5eff
- Geometric crystal motifs (faceted purple crystals on anvil)
- Subtle glow effects and shimmer animations
- Clean, technical aesthetic with military/enterprise undertones

TYPOGRAPHY & FORMATTING:

- Use <b> tags for emphasis inside <div> elements
- Headers get subtle glowing underlines (animated shimmer)
- BLUF boxes: light background with colored left border, subtle backdrop blur
- Code blocks: #141821 background, #cbb6ff text, #2f2a4f border
- Font sizes: 0.6-0.8rem for details, 0.95rem for subheadings, base for body

LAYOUT PATTERNS:

- top-title-two-cols (most common): columns: is-8 or is-9
- Include ":: title ::", ":: left ::", ":: right ::" sections
- Right column often contains diagrams/icons
- Fade-in animations: fade-in-left, fade-in-right with staggered delays

CONTENT STYLE:

- Lead with BLUF (Bottom Line Up Front) when appropriate
- Military-precise language: "cryptographic proof", "deterministic", "atomic"
- Contrast old problems with new solutions
- Use concrete examples and technical specifics
- Address multiple audiences: CTOs, sysadmins, security teams, compliance officers

IMAGE STYLE FOR GENERATION:

- Geometric low-poly aesthetic
- Purple/violet crystals (#9b7dd4, #8b6dc9, #7b5dbe color palette)
- Dark backgrounds (#1a1825 to #2a2835)
- Technical diagrams with clean lines
- Anvil/forge imagery represents "building/forging" systems
- Icons should be simple, flat, with subtle gradients
- Avoid photorealism—prefer illustrated/icon style

WHEN GENERATING IMAGES, USE THIS PROMPT:
"Create a minimalist technical diagram in a geometric style. Use a dark navy background (#1a1825). The main elements should be rendered in purple/violet tones (#9b7dd4 to #6f5eff) with clean geometric shapes and subtle glowing effects. The style should be flat but with slight depth through shading. Include [SPECIFIC ELEMENTS]. Keep it simple, professional, and suitable for a DevSecOps/infrastructure presentation."

SLIDE STRUCTURE TEMPLATE:

```markdown
---
layout: top-title-two-cols
color: dark
columns: is-8
class: text-left
---

:: title ::

# [Slide Title]

:: left ::

<div class="text-xs leading-snug fade-in-left">

[Main content with bullets]

<div class="mt-4 text-[#a8a8cc] text-[0.8rem] leading-snug">
[Supporting detail or context]
</div>

</div>

:: right ::

<div class="text-[0.7rem] fade-in-right">
  <img src="/assets/[diagram].png" alt="[Description]" class="max-w-[400px] opacity-95 mb-3" />
  <div class="text-[#999] italic text-[0.65rem]">
    [Image caption]
  </div>
</div>

<style>
.fade-in-left { opacity:0; transform:translateX(-10px); animation:fadeLeft 1.0s ease forwards; }
.fade-in-right{ opacity:0; transform:translateX( 10px); animation:fadeRight 1.0s ease .2s forwards; }
@keyframes fadeLeft { to { opacity:1; transform:none; } }
@keyframes fadeRight{ to { opacity:1; transform:none; } }
</style>
```

Now provide your slide content as:
TITLE: [slide title]
KEY POINTS: [3-5 bullet points]
CONTEXT: [any additional explanatory text]
IMAGE CONCEPT: [what should the diagram show]

```

## Usage Example

To use this, you'd say:

```

TITLE: Zero-Trust Architecture
KEY POINTS:

- Never trust, always verify every request
- Microsegmentation isolates workloads
- Identity-based access replaces network perimeters
  CONTEXT: Traditional perimeter security fails in cloud-native environments where boundaries dissolve
  IMAGE CONCEPT: Network diagram showing isolated segments with identity verification checkpoints
