### Our Interpretation of the GNU Affero General Public License v3

We believe this license provides the best balance between freedom for users and protection for contributors.  
Below is our non-binding interpretation of how we apply the AGPLv3 to Crystal Forge.  
(Quoted terms correspond to defined terms in the license itself.)

1. **Source and Attribution**  
   You must always provide the source code, copyright, and license
   information for Crystal Forge whenever you "convey" any part of it,
   whether verbatim or modified.

2. **Intended Use and Aggregation**  
   Crystal Forge was developed independently and without knowledge of
   your work. Therefore, it should generally be considered a separate
   work when combined with your own software, unless you have modified
   it directly.

   a. If you have *not* "modified", "adapted", or "extended" Crystal Forge,  
      your work is an "aggregate" and not subject to this license.

   b. If you *have* modified, adapted, or extended Crystal Forge,
      those modifications are considered a work "based on" Crystal Forge
      and must remain licensed under the AGPLv3.

3. **Compatibility with Other Licenses**  
   You may freely use Crystal Forge in projects licensed under:
   - the GNU General Public License version 2, or  
   - the GNU Lesser General Public License version 2.1,  
   as these licenses treat Crystal Forge as part of an "aggregate work."

4. **Community and Contact**  
   We welcome all questions and discussions regarding licensing.
   You may contact us at <crystal-forge-support@aicampground.com> or reach the
   Free Software Foundation at <licensing@fsf.org> for guidance.

We hope our interpretation of the AGPLv3 aligns with your own values
and that Crystal Forge proves useful, secure, and empowering for your projects.
